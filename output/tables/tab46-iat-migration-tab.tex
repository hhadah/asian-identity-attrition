\item[1] \footnotesize{Each column is an estimation of equations (\ref{eq:migration-3}) in column (1), 
                      (\ref{eq:migration-4}) in column (2), and
                      (\ref{eq:migration-5}) in column (3).}
\item[2] \footnotesize{Column (1) is a regression where the left hand side variable is 
                      a dummy variable that is equal to one if a person migrated from the state
                      were born in and the right hand side variable is bias the year of survey.
                      Column (2) is a regression where the left hand side variable is 
                      a dummy variable that is equal to one if a person migrated from the state
                      were born in and the right hand side variable is bias the year of birth in the state of birth.
                      Column (3) is a regression where the left hand side variable is 
                      the difference between state-level bias during the year of the survey in the current state the 
                      respondent is living in, and state-level bias during the year of birth in the state of birth 
                      and the right hand side variable is self-reported Asian identity. This regression captures
                      the selection of those that self-reported Asian identity into states with different levels of bias.
                      I include controls for sex, quartic age, parental education, fraction of Asians in a state, and region Ã— year fixed effects.
                      Standard errors are clustered on the state level.}
\item[3] \footnotesize{The samples include children ages 17 and below who live in intact families. 
                      Native-born second-generation Asian immigrant children with both
                      parents born in a Asian country. The sample in the column (3) regression is further restricted to only those that migrated from their birth state.}
