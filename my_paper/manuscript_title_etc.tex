\newcommand{\PAPERABSTRACT}{
I study the determinants of the choice to identify as Asian among those who couldâ€”those whose parents, grandparents, or selves were born in an Asian country. Using a multiple proxy regression approach, I construct a bias measure based on the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the American National Election Studies (ANES), and hate crimes against Asians. I find that individuals with Asian ancestry are significantly less likely to self-identify as Asian if they live in states with high levels of bias. A one standard deviation increase in bias decreases self-reported Asian identity by 9 percentage points for all immigrants. A one standard deviation increase in bias decreases self-reported Asian identity by 8 and 9 percentage points for second- and third-generation Asians respectively. These findings have implications for the interpretation of research on racial and ethnic gaps in economic outcomes and the correct counting of the population.
