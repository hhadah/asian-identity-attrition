\item[1] \footnotesize{Each column is an estimation of a heterogeneous effect of regression (\ref{eq:identity_reg_bias}) by 
                      generation with region Ã— year fixed effects. 
                      I include controls for sex, quartic age, fraction of Hispanics in a state, and parental education.
                      I also added parents' (HH, HW, and WH) and grandparents' (HHHH, HHHW, HHWH, etc.) type dummy variables to the regression
                      on second and third generation immigrants, where H is objectively Hispanic (born in a Spanish-Speaking Country) and W is objectively White (native-born). 
                      Standard errors are clustered on the state level.}
\item[2] \footnotesize{The samples include children ages 17 and below who live in intact families. 
                      First-generation Hispanic immigrant children that were born in a 
                      Spanish-speaking county. Native-born second-generation Hispanic 
                      immigrant children with at least one parent born in a Spanish-speaking 
                      country. Finally, native-born third-generation Hispanic immigrant children 
                      with native-born parents and at least one grandparent born in a Spanish-
                      speaking country.}
