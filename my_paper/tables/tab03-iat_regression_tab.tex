                      (\ref{eq:identity_reg_bias}) with different set of
                      fixed effects. I include controls for sex, quartic age, parental education, fraction of Hispanics in a state, and generational, parents' and grandparents' type dummy variables.
                      Standard errors are clustered on the state level.}
\item[2] \footnotesize{The samples include children ages 17 and below who live in intact families. 
                      First-generation Hispanic immigrant children that were born in a 
                      Spanish-speaking county. Native-born second-generation Hispanic 
                      immigrant children with at least one parent born in a Spanish-speaking 
                      country. Finally, native-born third-generation Hispanic immigrant children 
                      with native-born parents and at least one grandparent born in a Spanish 
                      speaking country.}
