\item[1] \footnotesize{Each column is an estimation of a heterogeneous effect of regression (\ref{eq:identity_reg_bias}) by 
                      generation with region × year fixed effects. 
                      I include controls for sex, quartic age, fraction of Asians in a state, and parental education.
                      I also added parents' (AA, AW, and WA) and grandparents' (AAAA, AAAW, AAWA, etc.) type dummy variables to the regression
                      on second and third generation immigrants, where A is objectively Asian (born in a Asian country) and W is objectively White (native-born). 
                      Standard errors are clustered on the state level.}
\item[2] \footnotesize{The samples include children ages 17 and below who live in intact families. 
                      First-generation Asian immigrant children that were born in a 
                      Asian country. Native-born second-generation Asian 
                      immigrant children with at least one parent born in a Asian 
                      country. Finally, native-born third-generation Asian immigrant children 
                      with native-born parents and at least one grandparent born in a Asian country.}
